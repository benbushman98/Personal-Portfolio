                <h1>Who is Benjamin Bushman?</h1>
                <img id="ben" src="./img/ben.jpg" alt="Professional portrait of Benjamin Bushman">
                <p>Ben was born in Delta, UT to a blind father and a seeing mother. Growing up
                with his 7 siblings, Ben has learned a thing or two about patience and hard work.
                With his father being extremely capable as a blind man, Ben still had to step up to the 
                plate and help in a lot of ways. 
                </p>

                <p> Ben's father, Sam, has been in in the information technology field for 35 years. Growing up,
                Ben was Sam's go to guy for all things tech. From a young age, he was helping setup computers,
                read webpages to his dad, and getting underneath tables to help route cables. 
                </p>
            
                <p> With this background in tech, he got his first job out of high school as a computer hardware technician. Refurbishing
                thousands of computers, Ben understands the fine details of diagnosis and repair. After several years
                working on computer hardware, Ben turned his attention to network administrating. With an understanding
                of the innerworkings of servers, switches, routers, and firewalls, he loves learning new ascpects 
                of IT. Web development is his newest skill he has set out to master.
